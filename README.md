# George's Portfolio Website

## Description
This is the third time I've made a portfolio website. I have used my time at Command Shift (FKA Manchester Codes) to learn loads about web development, and hopefully that shows in this website.\

Normally, I spend far more time on the asthetics than anything else - this time I will spend the first few commits building the bones of the website. I will make sure it's funcitonal before styling. (I will try, anyway!)\

I hope this site shows my passion for simple, accessible and good looking web design.

## Contents
As of writing this first draft of my readme, I intend to have the following content:
-Short intro to me.
-List of projects I've completed.
-Contact form 



## Thanks to:
- The tutors at Command Shift for all their help and support! 
- Emma for her design expertise and content writing experience!
- me : for working so hard :)
